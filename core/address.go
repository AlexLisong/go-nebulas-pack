[Account Address]
Similar to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Nebulas also adopts elliptic curve algorithm as its basic encryption algorithm for Nebulas accounts.
The address is derived from **public key**, which is in turn derived from the **private key** that encrypted with user's **passphrase**.
Also we have the checksum design aiming to prevent a user from sending _Nas_ to a wrong user account accidentally due to entry of several incorrect characters.

The specific calculation formula is as follows:

	Content = ripemd160( sha3_256( Public Key ) )
	CheckSum = sha3_256( 0x19 + 0x57 + Content )[0:4]
	Address = base58( 0x19 + 0x57 + Content + CheckSum )

 	0x57 is a one-byte "type code" for account address, 0x19 is a one-byte fixed "padding"

The ripemd160 digest of SHA3-256 digest of a public key serve as the major component of an address,
for which another SHA3-256 digest should be conducted and the first 4 bytes should be used as a checksum. For example:
The final address of Nebulas Wallet should be:  n1TV3sU6jyzR4rJ1D7jCAmtVGSntJagXZHC

[Smart Contract Address]
Calculating contract address differs slightly from account, passphrase of contract sender is not required but address & nonce.
For more information, plz check (https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/blob/master/tutorials/%5BEnglish%5D%20Nebulas%20101%20-%2003%20Smart%20Contracts%20JavaScript.md) and [rpc.sendTransaction](https://github.com/nebulasio/wiki/blob/master/rpc.md#sendtransaction).
Calculation formula is as follows:

	Content = ripemd160( sha3_256( tx.from, tx.nonce ) )
	CheckSum = sha3_256( 0x19 + 0x58 + Content )[0:4]
	Address = base58( 0x19 + 0x58 + Content + CheckSum )

	0x58 is a one-byte "type code" for smart contract address, 0x19 is a one-byte fixed "padding"


[TODO]
In addition to standard address with 50 characters, we also support extended address in order to ensure the security of transfers conducted by users.
The traditional bank transfer design is used for reference:
In the process of a bank transfer, bank card number of the remittee should be verified, in addition to which the remitter must enter the name of the remittee.
The transfer can be correctly processed only when the bank card number and the name match each other.
The generating algorithm for extended address is described as follows:

  ExtData = Utf8Bytes({Nickname or any string})
  ExtHash = sha3_256(Data + ExtData)[0:2]
  ExtAddress = Account Address + Hex(ExtHash)

An extended address is generated through addition of 2-byte extended verification to the end of a standard address and contains a total of 54 characters.
Addition of extended information allows the addition of another element verification to the Nebulas Wallet APP. For example:

	The standard address of Aliceâ€™s wallet is  0xdf4d22611412132d3e9bd322f82e2940674ec1bc03b20e40, and the extended address after addition of the nickname "alice" should be 0xdf4d22611412132d3e9bd322f82e2940674ec1bc03b20e40e345.
	Alice tells Bob the extended address 0xdf4d22611412132d3e9bd322f82e2940674ec1bc03b20e40e345 and her nickname alice.
	Bob enters 0xdf4d22611412132d3e9bd322f82e2940674ec1bc03b20e40e345 and alice in the Wallet App.
	The Wallet App verifies the consistency between the wallet address and the nickname in order to avoid the circumstance that Bob enters the account number of another user by mistake.
